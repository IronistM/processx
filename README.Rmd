Portable tools to run system processes in the background,
read their standard output and error, kill and restart them.

## Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
source("https://install-github.me/gaborcsardi/process")
```

## Usage

Note: the following external commands are usually present in macOS and
Linux systems, but not necessarily on Windows.

```{r}
library(process)
```

### Starting processes

`process` provides two ways to start processes. The first one
requires a single command, and a character vector of arguments.
Both the command and the arguments will be shell quoted, so it is safe
to include spaces and other special characters:

```{r}
p1 <- process$new("sleep", "20")
```

The other way is to supply a full shell command line via the
`commandline` argument:

```{r}
p2 <- process$new(commandline = "sleep 20")
```

Both methods will run the specified command or command line via the
`pipe` base R function, which currently uses a shell to start them.

### Killing and restarting a process

A process can be killed via the `kill` method. This also kills
all child processes.

```{r}
p1$is_alive()
p2$is_alive()
p1$kill()
p2$kill()
p1$is_alive()
p2$is_alive()
```

A process can be restarted via `restart`. This works if the process
has been killed, if it has finished regularly, or even if it is running
currently. If it is running, then it will be killed first.

```{r}
p1$restart()
p1$is_alive()
```

### Standard output and error

By default the standard output and error of the processes are lost,
but the `stdout` and `stderr` constructor arguments will keep them.
These can be set to a string pointing to a file name, or just to `TRUE`,
in which case temporary files are used to hold the output.

The `read_output_lines` and `read_error_lines` methods can be used
to read the standard output or error. They work the same way as the
`readLines` base function.

Note that the connections used for reading the output and error streams
are non-blocking text connections, so the read functions will return
immediately, even if there is no text to read from them.

```{r}
p <- process$new(
  commandline = "echo foo; >&2 echo bar; echo foobar",
  stdout = TRUE, stderr = TRUE
)
p$read_output_lines()
p$read_error_lines()
```

### End of output

### Waiting on a process

As seen before, `is_alive` checks if a process is running. The `wait`
method can be used to wait until it has finished. E.g. in the following
code `wait` needs to wait about 2 seconds for the `sleep` shell command
to finish.

```{r}
p <- process$new(commandline = "sleep 2")
p$is_alive()
Sys.time()
p$wait()
Sys.time()
```

It is safe to call `wait` multiple times:

```{r}
p$wait() # already finished!
```

### Exit statuses

After a process has finished, its exit status can be queried via the
`get_exit_status` method. If the process is still running, then this
method returns `NULL`.

```{r}
p <- process$new(commandline = "sleep 2")
p$get_exit_status()
p$wait()
p$get_exit_status()
```

Note that even if the process has finished, `get_exit_status` might report
`NULL` if `wait` was not called. If you know that the process has finished,
call `wait` first, and only then `get_exit_status`.

```{r}
p <- process$new(commandline = "true")

# wait until it surely finishes
Sys.sleep(1)
p$is_alive()
p$get_exit_status()

p$wait()
p$get_exit_status()
```

### Errors

Errors are typically signalled via non-zero exits statuses. `process`
currently has no special behavior to handle errors.

If you want to make sure that the process has started successfully,
check that it is running via `is_alive()`, and if it is not, then check
its exit status (after calling `wait`).

```{r, error = TRUE}
p <- process$new("nonexistant-command-for-sure")
if (!p$is_alive()) {
  p$wait()
  if (p$get_exit_status() != 0) {
    stop("nonexistant-command-for-sure failed")
  }
}
```
