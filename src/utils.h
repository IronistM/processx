/* Various OSes and OS versions return various poll codes when the
   child's end of the pipe is closed, so we cannot provide a more
   elaborate API. See e.g. http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/tech/poll.html
   In particular, (recent) macOS return both POLLIN and POLLHUP,
   Cygwin return POLLHUP, and most others return just POLLIN, so there
   is not way to distinguish. Essentially, if a read would not block,
   and the fd is still open, then we return with PXREADY.

   So for us, we just have:
